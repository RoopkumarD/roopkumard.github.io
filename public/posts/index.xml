      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One fine evening while I was out walking, I thought—why not record data from an offline retail clothing store and do some data analysis? I’m currently learning data analysis, and I wanted to actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; my knowledge, try stuff out, and hopefully learn something new. This report is the journey of me going from data collection all the way to analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After finishing everything, I can confidently say that my domain knowledge helped a lot during both the data collection and analysis process. It was honestly the main reason I could come up with the right questions to ask and actually answer them in a meaningful way. That domain knowledge came from me working in the shop for a few months, so I had some idea of how things worked on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
